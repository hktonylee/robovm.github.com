          One of the goals of RoboVM has been to enable the development of commercial,
          closed-source applications. In the runtime, 3rd party libraries have been 
          chosen carefully to avoid restricting how original source code consumed by 
          and binaries produced by the compiler may be used and distributed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each sub module in the <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/">GitHub repository</a> contains LICENSE.txt
          and NOTICE.txt files. The LICENSE.txt file contains the
          complete legal text for the license that module is released under.
          The NOTICE.txt file contains the copyright statement for the module
          and information on the licenses of any 3rd party dependencies used by
          the module.
        </p>

        <h2>Compile time tools</h2>

        <p>
          The compiler and the Eclipse plug-in are GPLv2 licensed. The compiler
          has a few 3rd party dependencies that have been released under different 
          open source licenses. For a complete list see the 
          <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/blob/master/compiler/NOTICE.txt">compiler/NOTICE.txt</a>
          file in the GitHub repostory.
        </p>

        <h2>Runtime libraries</h2>

        <p>
          Executables and apps produced by the compiler contain no GPLed code.
          The runtime class libraries and the runtime native libraries which are
          linked into the final binaries are all Apache License v2.0 licensed,
          licensed under BSD like licenses or placed in the public domain.
          For a complete list see the 
          <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/blob/master/vm/NOTICE.txt">vm/NOTICE.txt</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/blob/master/rt/NOTICE.txt">rt/NOTICE.txt</a>
          files in the GitHub repostory.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Objective-C bridge and CocoaTouch bindings have no external dependencies
          and are released under the Apache License v2.0.
