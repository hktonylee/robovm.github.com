        <h2>Installation instructions</h2>

        <h3>RoboVM compiler dependencies</h3>

        <p>The RoboVM compiler requires the following tools to be installed on your system:</p>

        * Java JDK 6 or newer - "Oracle's JDK":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html or "OpenJDK":http://openjdk.java.net should work
        * "LLVM 3.2":http://llvm.org/releases
        * An assembler - GCC (on Linux) and clang (on Mac OS X) are used as assembler frontends
        * A linker - GCC (on Linux) and clang (on Mac OS X) are used as linker frontends
        * Mac OS X only: To run iOS apps in the simulator or on a device you will need Xcode 4.5.2 installed

        <h4>Mac OS X</h4>

        <p>Download and install Java SE JDK 7 from "Oracle":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.</p>

        <p>Install "Xcode 4.5.2 from the Mac App Store":https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12. It includes clang and and the iOS simulator. Once installed start Xcode and install the "Command Line Tools" component from the Downloads section under the Xcode -> Preferences... menu.</p>

        <p>Download and install the LLVM tools to /opt/llvm by running the following commands in a terminal:</p>
        
        <pre>
          curl http://llvm.org/releases/3.2/clang+llvm-3.2-x86_64-apple-darwin11.tar.gz > llvm.tar.gz
          sudo mkdir -p /opt
          sudo tar xvfz llvm.tar.gz -C /opt
          sudo rm -f /opt/llvm
          sudo ln -s /opt/clang+llvm-3.2-x86_64-apple-darwin11 /opt/llvm
        </pre>

        <h4>Ubuntu 12.04 (AMD64)</h4>

        <p>Most of the required tools are available in the standard Ubuntu repositories. In a terminal:</p>

        <pre>
          sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib openjdk-7-jdk
        </pre>

        <p>Download and install the LLVM tools to /opt/llvm:</p>

        <pre>
          curl http://llvm.org/releases/3.2/clang+llvm-3.2-x86_64-linux-ubuntu-12.04.tar.gz > llvm.tar.gz
          sudo tar xvfz llvm.tar.gz -C /opt
          sudo rm -f /opt/llvm
          sudo ln -s /opt/clang+llvm-3.2-x86_64-linux-ubuntu-12.04 /opt/llvm
        </pre>

        <h3>Installing RoboVM</h3>

        <p><a href="http://download.robovm.org/robovm-{{site.robovm.version}}.tar.gz">Download the latest RoboVM release</a> or use a package built by following the <a href="#build">build instructions</a> then run the following commands in a terminal to install it to /opt/robovm:</p>

        <pre>
          sudo tar robovm-{{site.robovm.version}}.tar.gz -C /opt
          sudo rm -f /opt/robovm
          sudo ln -s /opt/robovm-{{site.robovm.version}} /opt/robovm
        </pre>

        <p>If you had a previous RoboVM version installed it is recommended that you remove the cache of compiled classes:</p>

        <pre>
          rm -rf ~/.robovm/cache
        </pre>

        <h2>Your first RoboVM program</h2>

        <p>
          Now let's compile a simple Java program into a native executable using RoboVM. First
          create <code>HelloWorld.java</code> in a new folder with the following contents:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
          public class HelloWorld {
          &nbsp;   public static void main(String[] args) {
          &nbsp;        System.out.println("Hello world!");
          &nbsp;    }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
          Compile the <code>HelloWorld.java</code> using <code>javac</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          mkdir classes
          javac -d classes/ HelloWorld.java
        </pre>

        <p>Finally, compile the Java bytecode into native code using:</p>
        <pre>
          /opt/robovm/bin/robovm -verbose -cp classes/ HelloWorld
        </pre>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <strong>Note!</strong> When you compile a program using RoboVM it will
          translate not only the main class into native code but also the 
          transitive dependencies of that main class. So the first time you compile
          a program for a particular CPU and OS RoboVM also compiles many
          of the standard runtime classes such as <code>java.lang.Object</code>,
          <code>java.lang.String</code>, etc. A simple class like <code>HelloWorld</code>
          references about 1500 classes directly or indirectly. RoboVM keeps a cache
          of compiled classes and only recompiles a class when it or any of its 
          direct dependencies have changed.
        </div>

        <p>
          You should now have a native executable called <code>HelloWorld/HelloWorld</code>. 
          Running it should print:</p>
        <pre>
          Hello world!
        </pre>

        <p>Let's take a quick peek at the contents of the <code>HelloWorld</code> folder:</p>
        <pre>
          HelloWorld/lib/boot/robovm-rt.jar
          HelloWorld/lib/classes0.jar
          HelloWorld/HelloWorld
        </pre>

        <p>
          This is the final product for this simple console program. Since we
          didn't specify a CPU or OS to the <code>/opt/robovm/bin/robovm</code>
          command the compiler will produce a binary which can be run on the 
          current system (either Linux or Mac OS X).
        </p>
        <p>
          The jar files in 
          <code>HelloWorld/lib/boot/</code> are the jar files which were
          specified using the <code>-bootclasspath</code> command line argument.
          Since we didn't specify anything RoboVM will add <code>robovm-rt.jar</code> for us.
          The jar files directly in <code>HelloWorld/lib</code> are the jar files
          specified using <code>-cp</code> argument. If one specifies a path (like we did) 
          rather than a jar file RoboVM will archive the contents of that path
          in a jar file and call it <code>classes0.jar</code> (subsequent paths 
          will be archived to <code>classes1.jar</code>, <code>classes2.jar</code>, etc).
          The jar files will be stripped from <code>.class</code> files. The reason
          why the jar files are included by stripped is to make it possible to 
          store property files, images, etc in the classpath rather than in the
          file system.
        </p>

        <h2>A simple iOS app</h2>

        <p>
          While it's nice to be able to make native console programs like we did above
          the main goal of RoboVM is to make it possible to develop iOS apps in Java.
          Let's make a very simple iOS app. Put the following into <code>IOSDemo.java</code>:

          <h1>Building from source</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>Build prerequisites</h2>

        In order to get the source code and build RoboVM you will need the following tools:

        * "Git":http://git-scm.com
        * "CMake 2.8.8 or newer":http://www.cmake.org
        * Java JDK 6 or newer - "Oracle's JDK":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html or "OpenJDK":http://openjdk.java.net should work
        * "Maven 3":http://maven.apache.org
        * C/C++ compiler - GCC on Linux, clang on Mac OS X

        <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
        
        <p>Download and install Java SE JDK 7 from "Oracle":http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html.</p>

        <p>Install "Xcode 4.5.2 from the Mac App Store":https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12. It includes clang. Once installed start Xcode and install the "Command Line Tools" component from the Downloads section under the Xcode -> Preferences... menu.</p>

        <p>Download and install CMake.</p>
        
        <p>Get Maven from the URL above and install it.</p>

        <h4>Ubuntu 12.04 (AMD64)</h4>

        <p>Most of the required tools are available in the standard Ubuntu repositories. In a terminal:</p>

        <pre>
          sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc-multilib git openjdk-7-jdk maven
        </pre>

        <p>The cmake version in Ubuntu 12.04 is too old so we use the version from Ubuntu 12.10:</p>

        <pre>
          wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cmake/cmake_2.8.9-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
          wget http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/c/cmake/cmake-data_2.8.9-0ubuntu1_all.deb
          sudo dpkg -i cmake*.deb
        </pre>

        <h2>Building RoboVM</h2>

        <p>Run the following commands in a terminal to build RoboVM:</p>

        <pre>
          git clone https://github.com/robovm/robovm.git
          cd robovm/vm
          ./build.sh --build=Debug
          cd ..
          mvn -DskipTests=true clean install
        </pre>

        <p>You should now have a tar.gz package in dist/target that you can install using the <a href="#getting-started">instructions</a> above.</p>

          chosen carefully to avoid restricting how original source code consumed by 
          and binaries produced by the compiler may be used and distributed.
