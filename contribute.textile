        <p>
          Want to start hacking on this project? Patches are always welcome! Just
          fork the <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm">repository</a> and
          submit a pull request when you're done. Original code contributions 
          (i.e. code written by you) to any of the compile time tools (e.g. the 
          <code>compiler</code> and the <code>eclipse</code> modules) must be 
          licensed under the GPLv2 license. Original code contributions to the
          runtime libraries must be licensed under the Apache License v2.0. We
          will not accept runtime library code contributions that have 3rd party 
          dependencies licensed under any version of the GPL or the LGPL.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Java code contributions please make sure you use the proper 
          Formatter and Code Templates in Eclipse by importing the global 
          <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/blob/master/formatter.xml">formatter.xml</a>
          file and the codetemplates.xml file corresponding to the module you're 
          working on. We use CamelCase for type, function and variable names.
          We use only spaces, and indent 4 spaces at a time. No newline before 
          the start brace of blocks. American English spelling is preferred (e.g. 
          'color' instead of 'colour').
        </p>
        <p>
          For C/C++ code contributions please use coding style similar to the
          Java coding conventions described above. Have a look at the code in
          <code>vm/core/</code> if unsure.
        </p>

          <h1>Contributor License Agreement</h1>
        </div>

        <p> 
          We request that all contributors of ideas, code, or documentation to
          the RoboVM project complete, sign, and submit an <a href="http://download.robovm.org/cla/RoboVM-ICLA.pdf">Individual Contributor License
          Agreement</a> (CLA). The purpose of this agreement is to clearly define the terms
          under which intellectual property has been contributed to the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a corporation that has assigned employees to work on RoboVM, a <a href="http://download.robovm.org/cla/RoboVM-CCLA.pdf">Corporate CLA</a> (CCLA) is available for contributing intellectual property via the corporation, that may have been assigned as part of an employment agreement. Note that a Corporate CLA does not remove the need for every developer to sign their own CLA as an individual, to cover any of their contributions which are not owned by the corporation signing the CCLA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Print the CLA, sign it and scan it (or use a camera to photograph it) and e-mail it to 
          <a href="mailto:robovm(at)robovm.org">robovm(at)robovm.org</a>. Include
          your GitHub user name in the e-mail.
