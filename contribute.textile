          Before we can accept your code contributions you must sign and submit
          a <a href="#cla">Contributors License Agreement</a>.
        </div>

        <p>
          Want to start hacking on this project? Patches are always welcome! Just
          fork the <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm">repository</a> and
          submit a pull request when you're done. Original code contributions 
          (i.e. code written by you) to any of the compile time tools (e.g. the 
          <code>compiler</code> and the <code>eclipse</code> modules) must be 
          licensed under the GPLv2 license. Original code contributions to the
          runtime libraries must be licensed under the Apache License v2.0. We
          will not accept runtime library code contributions that have 3rd party 
          dependencies licensed under any version of the GPL or the LGPL.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Java code contributions please make sure you use the proper 
          Formatter and Code Templates in Eclipse by importing the global 
          <a href="https://github.com/robovm/robovm/blob/master/formatter.xml">formatter.xml</a>
          file and the codetemplates.xml file corresponding to the module you're 
          working on. We use CamelCase for type, function and variable names.
          We use only spaces, and indent 4 spaces at a time. No newline before 
          the start brace of blocks. American English spelling is preferred (e.g. 
          'color' instead of 'colour').
        </p>
        <p>
          For C/C++ code contributions please use coding style similar to the
          Java coding conventions described above. Have a look at the code in
          <code>vm/core/</code> if unsure.
        </p>

      <section id="cla">

          <h1>Contributors License Agreement</h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          The Contributors License Agreement comes in two flavors, one for 
          <a href="http://download.robovm.org/cla/RoboVM-HA-CLA-I-ANY.pdf">individual contributors</a>
          and one for <a href="http://download.robovm.org/cla/RoboVM-HA-CLA-E-ANY.pdf">entities</a>
          (companies, foundations, or other organizations). Print it, sign it
          and scan it (or use a camera to photograph it) and e-mail it to 
          <a href="mailto:robovm(at)robovm.org">robovm(at)robovm.org</a>. Include
          your GitHub user name in the e-mail.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are making a contribution that is not your work (for example, a 
          patch or library written by someone else), please contact 
          <a href="mailto:robovm(at)robovm.org">robovm(at)robovm.org</a> for 
          guidance on whether any additional steps are needed.
